## 🔥 Opening Firewall Port 5000

To allow other devices (phones, tablets, other computers) to access your tracker, you need to open port 5000 in your firewall.

### Linux (CachyOS/Arch/Most Distributions)

#### Using UFW (Ubuntu/Debian-based):
```bash
# Enable UFW if not already enabled
sudo ufw enable

# Allow port 5000
sudo ufw allow 5000

# Check status
sudo ufw status
```

#### Using firewalld (Fedora/RHEL/CentOS):
```bash
# Allow port 5000
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=5000/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# Check status
sudo firewall-cmd --list-ports
```

#### Using iptables (Advanced users):
```bash
# Allow incoming connections on port 5000
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 5000 -j ACCEPT

# Save rules (method varies by distribution)
# Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

# RHEL/CentOS:
sudo service iptables save
```

### Windows

#### Method 1: Windows Defender Firewall (GUI)
1. Open **Windows Security** → **Firewall & network protection**
2. Click **Advanced settings**
3. Click **Inbound Rules** → **New Rule**
4. Select **Port** → **Next**
5. Select **TCP** and enter **5000** in specific ports
6. Select **Allow the connection** → **Next**
7. Apply to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public) → **Next**
8. Name it "Empyrion Resource Tracker" → **Finish**

#### Method 2: Command Line (PowerShell as Administrator)
```powershell
# Allow inbound traffic on port 5000
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Empyrion Resource Tracker" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 5000 -Action Allow

# Verify the rule was created
Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Empyrion Resource Tracker"
```

#### Method 3: Command Prompt (as Administrator)
```cmd
# Allow inbound traffic on port 5000
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Empyrion Resource Tracker" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=5000

# List all rules to verify
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name="Empyrion Resource Tracker"
```

## 📱 Mobile Access

After opening the firewall port:

1. **Find your computer's IP address:**
   - Linux: `ip addr show` or `hostname -I`
   - Windows: `ipconfig` (look for IPv4 Address)

2. **Access from phone/tablet:**
   - Connect to the same WiFi network
   - Open browser and go to `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:5000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5000`

4. Add resources by clicking **"+ Add"** in the Resources column
5. Changes are saved automatically

### Resource Management

- **Add resources:** Click the **"+ Add"** button in any Resources cell

### Filtering

Use the filter controls at the top to find specific locations:

- **Name:** Search system or sector names
- **Type:** Filter by Sector, Planet, or Moon
- **Danger:** Filter by Low, Medium, or High danger levels
- **Resource:** Find all locations containing specific resources

### Distance Tracking

- Set your reference point in **"Distance from"** field

### Backup Your Data

```bash
# Simply copy the database file
cp empyrion_resources.db empyrion_resources_backup.db
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Can't Access from Other Devices

1. **Check firewall:** Ensure port 5000 is open (see instructions above)
2. **Check IP address:** Make sure you're using the correct IP
3. **Same network:** Ensure all devices are on the same WiFi/network
4. **Antivirus:** Some antivirus software may block the connection

### Application Won't Start

1. **Check Python version:** Requires Python 3.7+
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. **Install Flask:**
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

3. **Check port availability:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/Mac
   netstat -tuln | grep 5000
   
   # Windows
   netstat -an | findstr 5000
   ```

### Database Issues

If you encounter database errors:

```bash
# Delete the database file to start fresh
rm empyrion_resources.db

# Restart the application
python empyrion_tracker.py
```

## 🚀 Advanced Usage

### Custom Port

To run on a different port, modify the last line in `empyrion_tracker.py`:

```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=False)  # Change 5000 to 8080
```

### Running as a Service

For permanent deployment, consider running as a system service:

#### Linux (systemd)

Create `/etc/systemd/system/empyrion-tracker.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Empyrion Resource Tracker
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your-username
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/tracker
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 empyrion_tracker.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
sudo systemctl enable empyrion-tracker
sudo systemctl start empyrion-tracker
```
